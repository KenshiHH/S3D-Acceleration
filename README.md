# S3D-Acceleration
simplify3d is missing the feature to change the acceleration based on the different prinint typed (infill|outer perimeter|inner perimter etc.)
i love this feature in cura so i made a small tool to add these settings to gcode files created via simplify3d.

manual:

open file, change the acceleration values and hit modify.
it will create a new gcode file based in the folder of the seleced file with the same name but with a "_patched" added to the end of the name.
